# Dissertation Project
Arcade games surged in popularity and importance as a pastime in the late 1970s, before the evolution
of home computers. The primitive technology available to game makers meant that the game’s
features were restricted by their ‘8-bit’ system architectures. This constrained the game design and
capabilities, which resulted in a very distinctive style of pixelated graphics and synthetic audio.

The aim of this project was to produce a video game inspired by the retro graphical, audible and
gameplay styles present in arcade games of the ‘8-bit’ era. The game was programmed and its
performance checked by running tests on both low and medium powered computers.

The functioning game produced, which can be played on a computer, was inspired by graphical and
audible styles true to the period. It provides enjoyment for both experienced and inexperienced
players by incorporating progressive difficulty.
